                  <h2>1. AI and Machine Learning Integration</h2>
                  <p>AI and machine learning are revolutionising how search engines rank content. In 2024, businesses must leverage AI tools to optimise their websites, from content creation to SEO analysis. Understanding algorithms like Google's RankBrain will help businesses tailor their strategies to meet the changing demands of search engine optimisation.</p>
                  
                  <h2>2. Voice Search Optimization</h2>
                  <p>With the rise of smart speakers and voice-activated devices, voice search is becoming increasingly popular. In 2024, optimising for voice search will be essential. Businesses should focus on natural language processing and long-tail keywords to cater to voice queries.

                  <h2>4. Video Content as a Priority</h2>
                  <p>Video content is a powerful tool for engagement and SEO. In 2024, businesses should incorporate more video into their content strategies, as search engines increasingly favour video in SERPs. Creating informative and entertaining video content can help improve search visibility and enhance user experience.</p>
