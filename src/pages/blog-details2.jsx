                  <h1>Cybersecurity in 2024: Protecting Your Business from Emerging Threats</h1>
                  
                  <p>As businesses embrace the digital age, cybersecurity remains a growing concern. In 2024, cyber threats are more sophisticated and harder to detect than ever before, making robust cybersecurity practices essential. This article explores the latest threats and how you can protect your business from emerging risks.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Ransomware Attacks on the Rise</h2>
                  <p>Ransomware has evolved into one of the most destructive forms of cybercrime. In 2024, attackers are not only encrypting data but also threatening to leak sensitive information unless a ransom is paid. To defend against this, businesses must invest in strong backup systems, regular patching, and employee training to avoid falling victim to phishing attempts.</p>
                  
                  <motion.div className="image"
                    initial="offscreen"
                    whileInView="onscreen"
                    variants={slideUp(1)}
                    viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.1 }}
                  >
                    <img src={blog_img} alt="Cybersecurity in 2024" />
                  </motion.div>

                  <p>Regularly updating software, deploying multi-layered security measures, and conducting routine penetration testing are essential steps for mitigating ransomware attacks.</p>

                  <h2>AI-Driven Cyberattacks</h2>
                  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionising the cybersecurity landscape—not only for defenders but also for attackers. Cybercriminals are leveraging AI to launch more sophisticated attacks, including automated phishing and adaptive malware. AI-based threats can bypass traditional security measures, requiring businesses to adopt AI-driven defence mechanisms to stay ahead.</p>

                  <h2>Cloud Security Threats</h2>
                  <p>With more businesses moving their operations to the cloud, securing cloud environments is critical. Misconfigurations, weak access controls, and lack of encryption remain top vulnerabilities. In 2024, implementing a zero-trust architecture, encryption for data at rest and in transit, and regular cloud audits will be vital for protecting sensitive information.</p>

                  <motion.blockquote
                    initial="offscreen"
                    whileInView="onscreen"
                    variants={slideUp(1)}
                    viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.1 }}
                  >
                    “The shift to cloud computing, along with increasing AI-driven attacks, means businesses need to be more vigilant than ever before in securing their digital environments.”
                  </motion.blockquote>

                  <h2>Social Engineering and Insider Threats</h2>
                  <p>While technology plays a critical role in cybersecurity, human error continues to be a leading cause of breaches. Social engineering tactics, such as phishing and pretexting, target employees to gain access to sensitive systems. Insider threats, whether intentional or accidental, are also a major concern in 2024. To combat this, businesses must invest in comprehensive employee education and implement strict access controls.</p>

                  <h2>Securing IoT Devices</h2>
                  <p>With the Internet of Things (IoT) continuing to expand, unsecured IoT devices present an increasingly significant risk. Smart devices can be exploited to gain access to a network or be used as part of a botnet in larger cyberattacks. Businesses should prioritise securing IoT endpoints with strong authentication protocols and ensure regular updates to protect these devices.</p>

                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>In 2024, businesses face a rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. By staying informed about the latest threats and adopting proactive security measures such as AI-driven defences, zero-trust frameworks, and ongoing employee education, your organisation can safeguard its digital assets and stay ahead of emerging threats.</p>
